# Website Blocker

## About <a name = "about"></a>

This extension is powerful. You don’t need to switch off the extension if you want to watch a specific individual video. There’s less psychological cost than finding a site fully blocked. Instead you see the site load, but the distracting content is replaced with a motivating message.
